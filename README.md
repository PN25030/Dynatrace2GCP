# Integrating Dynatrace Monitoring and Alerting with Google Cloud

## Overview
This guide provides detailed instructions to integrate Dynatrace's monitoring and alerting features with Google Cloud. Dynatrace is a robust observability platform offering real-time insights into your applications, infrastructure, and user experience. Integrating Dynatrace with Google Cloud allows you to monitor cloud resources, applications, and services, and set up alerts for anomalies or performance issues.

## Prerequisites
Before beginning the integration, ensure you have the following:
1. **Dynatrace Account**: An active Dynatrace account with administrative access.
2. **Google Cloud Account**: A Google Cloud project with permissions to create service accounts and configure IAM roles.
3. **Dynatrace OneAgent**: Installed on the Google Cloud resources (e.g., Compute Engine VMs, Kubernetes clusters) you wish to monitor.
4. **API Access**: Enabled for both Dynatrace and Google Cloud.

## Step 1: Set Up Dynatrace Environment
1. Log in to your Dynatrace account.
2. Go to **Deploy Dynatrace** > **Start Installation**.
3. Choose **Google Cloud Platform** as the environment.
4. Follow the instructions to download and install the Dynatrace OneAgent on your Google Cloud resources.

## Step 2: Create a Service Account in Google Cloud
1. Open the **Google Cloud Console**.
2. Go to **IAM & Admin** > **Service Accounts**.
3. Click **Create Service Account**.
   - Provide a name (e.g., `dynatrace-monitoring`).
   - Assign the following roles:
     - `Monitoring Viewer`
     - `Logging Viewer`
     - `Compute Viewer`
4. Click **Done** and create a key for the service account in JSON format. Download the key file.

## Step 3: Configure Dynatrace to Connect to Google Cloud
1. Log in to your Dynatrace account.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Cloud and Virtualization** > **Google Cloud Platform**.
3. Click **Add Google Cloud Platform**.
4. Provide the following details:
   - **Name**: A unique name for the integration.
   - **Service Account Key**: Upload the JSON key file downloaded in Step 2.
5. Click **Connect** to establish the connection between Dynatrace and Google Cloud.

---

## Step 4: Enable Monitoring for Google Cloud Services
1. In Dynatrace, go to **Technologies** > **Google Cloud Platform**.
2. Enable monitoring for the Google Cloud services you want to monitor (e.g., Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, BigQuery, etc.).
3. Dynatrace will automatically start collecting metrics and logs from the configured services.

---

## Step 5: Set Up Alerts in Dynatrace
1. Go to **Settings** > **Anomaly Detection** > **Metrics**.
2. Define custom metrics or use predefined metrics for Google Cloud services.
3. Go to **Settings** > **Alerts** > **Alerting Profiles**.
4. Create a new alerting profile or modify an existing one.
   - Add conditions based on metrics (e.g., CPU usage, memory usage, error rates).
   - Configure notification channels (e.g., email, Slack, PagerDuty).
5. Save the alerting profile.

---

## Step 6: Validate the Integration
1. In Dynatrace, go to **Hosts** or **Services** to verify that your Google Cloud resources are being monitored.
2. Check the **Problems** section to ensure alerts are being triggered based on the configured conditions.
3. Test the notification channels to confirm that alerts are being delivered.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **No Data in Dynatrace**: Ensure the Dynatrace OneAgent is installed and running on your Google Cloud resources.
- **Permission Errors**: Verify that the service account has the required IAM roles.
- **Alert Notifications Not Working**: Check the notification channel configuration in Dynatrace.
